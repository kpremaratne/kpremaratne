- 👋 Hi, I’m @kpremaratne
- 👀 I’m interested in uncertainty modeling (in particular Dempster-Shafer theory and inteval-valued probabilities), machine learning and knowledge discovery
from imperfect data, opinion and consensus dynamics in social networks, and network science and graph theory.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning graph spectral clustering (in particular, clustering in large graphs).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the areas mentioned above.
- 📫 How to reach me: kamal@miami.edu
